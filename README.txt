TAG
===

It's 2018, should be able to tag media files with colors and fonts,
right ?

Actually my claim is not HTML, but that ID3 sucks because ideas before
HTTP era were ideas before HTTP era.

However the attack method is the same : start with end of file
tagging, support anywhere tagging in players, win at start of file
tagging.

Tagging is inline or offline, uses XML tags for extensible purposes,
and HTML support for fonts is a side effect.
